# Debugging

- A project during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/), a course offered by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). 

## Technologies 

- Files written in ```vi```, ```vim```, and ```emacs``` editors. 
- C files compiled using ```gcc 9.4.0```.
- C files wriiten according to the betty coding style. Checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).
- Files tested on ```Ubuntu 20.04```  LTS using ```gcc```.

## Files

| Filename  | Description |
| ---  | --- |
|[0-main.c](0-main.c)| This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.|
|[1-main.c](1-main.c)|Indeifying and commenting out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop without deleting the part.|
|[2-largest_number.c](2-largest_number.c)|This program prints the largest of three integers. The task involves fixing the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.|
|[3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c)|This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. The task involves correcting the code to output looks good for ```04/01/1997!```. The tasks is also to fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.|
|[main.h](main.h)|Customer header file|
